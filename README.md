- ⚡ Fun fact: The term "bug" in computer programming originated from an actual insect. In 1947, when computers were still in their early stages,
  a team at Harvard University discovered a malfunctioning computer caused by a moth that had gotten trapped between the relays.
  They removed the moth and documented the event as the "first actual case of a bug being found."
  From then on, the term "bug" has been widely used in the programming community to refer to any error or issue in a software program.
